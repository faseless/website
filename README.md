# website
You might notice that my website, if you loaded in the files, is both incomplete and like, really ugly, so you might be wondering, "why the heck do I even have this hear?".
Well, to me it's pretty simple. I'm not making my GitHub as a place to show off and such, I'm simply not about that life. To me, it's the process that counts, and my GitHub is here to help me document that proces.
For the same reasons, I'm not making my website all fancy and such before I upload it GitHub. My website is a place for my to experiment and learn, and I see no reason to hide that matter.
That's all.
